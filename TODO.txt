//make condition_variable correct
done, but big problem. Need to sync AV-types like codec_context (im clearing buffers while decoding).

add multithread decoding
change main time to depend on audio time
lagging when seeking (move seeking into different threads)
make correct destroying frameoutput loop (QML VideoSink destroys first)
ui menubar hides when seeking
add timebar above handle when seeking
add preload image on seeking
fix ui resizing

find out how works volume in samples
add stretching
